## Jonathan Nelson

Hello, my name is Dr. Jonathan Nelson, and I am an Assistant Professor in the Division of Nephrology & Hypertension at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. I completed my undergraduate studies in Biochemistry at the University of Washington before earning my PhD in Molecular and Medical Genetics at Oregon Health & Science University. My research focuses on vascular biology and the renin-angiotensin system, particularly how it regulates the kidney microvasculature. I am passionate about using translational research to better understand kidney disease and improve outcomes for patients with vascular and renal conditions.

Hello, my name is Sienna Blanche, and I am a Master's student at the University of Southern California studying Global Medicine. In Dr. Nelson's lab, work as a research assistant analyzing kidney gene expression using single-nucleus RNA sequencing. In the future, I aspire to become a physician dedicated to advancing women’s health and global health equity by integrating clinical practice with research to improve patient outcomes.

Hi! My name is Roman Thomas, and I am a fourth year undergraduate student at Vanderbilt University majoring in Biochemistry and Medicine, Health, & Society on the premed track. I am doing research in Dr. Jonathan Nelson’s lab to develop a manuscript that provides insight into a standardized way to identify cell types in the kidney through single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis with the use of R.
