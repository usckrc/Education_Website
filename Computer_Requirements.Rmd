These are the minimum system requirements for being able to smoothly run the ROC assignments. 

*You may not be able to comfortably complete all ROCâ€™s if you don't meet these requirements.*

*The faster the computer, the quicker your analysis will be*

## Requirements for Running R

<span style="color:red;">Minimum Requirements</span>

**Processor**: Dual-core processor (e.g., Intel i3 or equivalent).

**RAM**: 4 GB (sufficient for small datasets and basic analyses).

**Storage**: At least 10 GB of free disk space for R installation and small datasets.

**Operating System**:

Windows 7/8/10/11 (64-bit recommended).

macOS (latest versions supported).


## Recommended Specifications for Larger Datasets

**Processor**: Quad-core or better (e.g., Intel i5/i7, AMD Ryzen 5/7).

**RAM**: 16 GB or more to handle larger datasets and computationally intensive tasks.

**Storage**: SSD with at least 100 GB free space for faster read/write operations.

**Graphics Card**: Not required unless using specialized R packages that leverage GPU acceleration.

## Key Considerations

For datasets **larger** than 1 GB, more RAM is crucial to avoid memory bottlenecks.

Ensure you use a 64-bit version of both your operating system and R to utilize more than 4 GB of RAM.

Analysis frameworks such as Seurat, Scanpy, or Harmony:

Seurat can run on systems with < 16 GB RAM but benefits from higher memory for larger datasets.

### Reference:

*I was able to complete up to ROC#3 with a 2020 Macbook Air.*

*I could complete every ROC with ease with a 2024 Macbook Pro with 24 G of RAM.*

wanted to add pictures but not completely sure how to edit photo sizes and write around it or add arrows etc.
