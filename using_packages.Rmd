# Intro to Packages 

Packages are collections of functions that help users perform specific tasks. They are useful for visualization, statistical analysis, data manipulation, reproducibility, and even bioinformatics itself. For this example, you will learn how to install **ggplot2** which is used for advanced plot creation as well as **dplyr** which is used for cleaning and transforming data. 

# Installing packages

## Step 1: Download the package

### Step 1a: Download one package

There are many ways to download a package. The easiest and most straight forward way to do so is by using the **install.packages** function. This is a base R function which means you do not need to load any libraries to use it.

To download a package using **install.packages** you simply need to type it or copy it into your R Script and run it. To run a line of code on a Mac click on the number to the left of the line, press Command + Enter. For Windows the procedure is the same but you should press Control + Enter. In this example I am downloading the package **ggplot2**.

![](`r here::here("Images", "PG_Screenshot 6.png")`)

### Step 1b: Download multiple packages

To run many lines of code press the number to the left of at the start of the series of code you want to run then hold and drag to the number to the left of the end of the series of code you want to run. Alternatively you can click the Run button in the top right corner which will run the entire R Script. In this example I am downloading the packages **ggplot2** and **dplyr**.

![](`r here::here("Images", "PG_Screenshot 7.png")`)

# Verfying packages  

There are a number of steps to take to verify you have successfully downloaded a package. The first marker that you are on the right path is when you get this message in the R console.

![](`r here::here("Images", "PG_Screenshot 8.png")`)

Secondly, you will want to switch from the default **Plots** page to the **Packages** page to check that the packages has been downloaded. **Packages** that have been installed but not  loaded in the session will appear unchecked in the **Packages** section as seen below.

![](`r here::here("Images", "PG_Screenshot 9.png")`)

# Special Packages

Some packages you cannot access from R and will have to get from outside sources, like GitHub. For example, the package **DoubletFinder** is useful for predicting doublets in scRNA-seq data which cleans the data and makes it easier to work with. To download a package from GitHub you will access the users GitHub page and copy the line to install.
