Hello thank you so much for your contributions to the Nelson lab! and This page explains how to structure and format your tutorials so they are consistent across the site.

# File Naming

Please name all files using **snake_case**, lowercase letters with underscores between words.

Examples:

**github_tutorial.Rmd** <br>
**lesson_1.Rmd** <br>
**index.Rmd** <br>

# Tutorial Structure

Please including headings and subheadings in your tutorials where appropriate! 

# Including Images 

Please feel free to include images and videos in your tutorials! When including them please follow these guidelines:

1. Save all images in the images/ folder inside your tutorial’s directory. Please make sure the images folder is saved in all lowercase. <br>
2. Use snake_case for all image file names (for example, gene_expression_plot.png). <br>
3. To display an image in your tutorial, write the following line of code as shown below (do not remove the backticks or quotes) and include an **r** after the first backtick and before the here: <br>

```
![](` here::here("images", "your_folder", "your_image_name.png")`)
```

# How to Submit

When your tutorial is ready:

Save your .Rmd file and all related images (in an images folder) in a single folder.

Email the folder to slblanch@usc.edu with the subject line:
“Tutorial Submission – [Tutorial Title]”
